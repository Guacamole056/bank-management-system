# **SIMPLE BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

## **Introduction**
This project aims to develop a Simple Bank Management System utilizing the C programming language. The system will automate essential banking operations, including account management, fund transfers, and balance inquiries, providing us with a practical learning experience in programming and software development.

## **Background (Research & Project Selection)**
During our work in this project, we viewed many banking applications to understand user interfaces and the functionalities to be supported in these established systems. We used this observation to structure our core features in a system with high accessibility and ease of navigation.

## **Project Specification**
The project delivered mostly the basic features required for a basic banking system. Advanced features like online banking and complex security measures were kept out of its scope so as not to over-complicate the system.

## **Problem Analysis**
The described solution addresses the development of a software system for managing user accounts, focusing on simplicity and functionality. Below is an analysis of the core problem and its requirements:

The goal is to create a basic account management system that allows users to:

Create new accounts.  
Store and retrieve account data efficiently.  
Ensure data persistence between program sessions.
